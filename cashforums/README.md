# Cash Forums

This one isn't dockerized simply because dealing with MySQL + PHP + Apache was a hassle :P

To set-up, install MySQL and create a database named "cashforums" and a user named sql-user who can read from that database. Import "dump.sql" in there. Install Apache and PHP7, then move everything in html/ to /var/www/html/
